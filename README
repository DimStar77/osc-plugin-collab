This directory contains a small set of scripts that aim to make it
easier to analyze the openSUSE packages. This is used by the GNOME team,
so the default settings might need to be changed for uses by other
teams.

All data created will be created in /tmp/obs-dissector unless the
OBS_DISSECTOR_DIR environment variable is set.


create-database:
    Based on a checkout of packages (made with obs-checkout, eg), this
    script gathers data from all packages in a database so that it's
    easy to analyze.
    See also 'create-database --help'.

download-gnome-versions:
    Download information about the latest versions of various GNOME
    modules.

gnome-opensuse-match.txt:
    Data file that matches upstream GNOME module names to openSUSE
    source package names.

obs-checkout:
    Check out packages from specified project.
    By default, it just uses $OBS_DISSECTOR_DIR/obs-co-stable as
    destination directory, but there are some options to use various
    directories. See how it's being used in runme, for example.
    There are various options to select what to check out, and how to
    check out.
    This script should not be run too frequently because it does many
    requests on the Build Service servers.
    See also 'obs-checkout --help'.

osc-gnome.py:
    A osc plugin for collaboration within the openSUSE GNOME Team.
    Copy in ~/.osc-plugins/ and check 'osc gnome --help' out.

runme:
    Small helper to show how to use everything, and get some data from
    scratch.
