This directory contains a small set of scripts that aim to make it
easier to analyze the openSUSE packages. This is used by the GNOME team,
so the default settings might need to be changed for uses by other
teams.

All data created will be created in /tmp/obs-dissector unless the
OBS_DISSECTOR_DIR environment variable is set.


create-database:
    Based on a checkout of packages (made with obs-checkout, eg), this
    script gathers data from all packages in a database so that it's
    easy to analyze.
    See also 'create-database --help'.

download-gnome-versions:
    Download information about the latest versions of various GNOME
    modules.

gnome-opensuse-match.txt:
    Data file that matches upstream GNOME module names to openSUSE
    source package names.

obs-checkout:
    Check out packages from specified projects. By default, this assumes
    the project has a "parent" like openSUSE:Factory (eg: GNOME:Factory is
    considered a "child" of openSUSE:Factory).
    It will create a $OBS_DISSECTOR_DIR/obs-co-stable directory that
    contains all the checked out files.
    This script should not be run too frequently because it does many
    requests on the Build Service servers.
    See also 'obs-checkout --help'.

runme:
    Small helper to show how to use everything, and get some data from
    scratch.
