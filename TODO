+ Put server code in git.
+ Make --xs the default for 'osc gnome t'
  For t: maybe check the version in the home project?
+ add 'osc gnome validate/check': make sure that committing is fine
+ osc collab todo:
  - list build failures (with the status api)
+ 'osc gnome update':
  - print information about rpmlint of this package
  - prefill the .changes with "Updated translations"?
  - check integrity with md5sum/sha1sum
  - integrate with spec-cleaner
+ 'osc gnome todoadmin':
  - use get_obs_build_results
  - handle the case where there's already a submission to oS:F but the
    submission is not from the latest revision of the package in G:F
+ 'osc gnome forward':
  - cancel old requests (automatically? ask?)
  - use 'osc meta prj GNOME:Factory' to see how to check for permissions.
+ 'osc gnome build/buildsubmit':
  - if the package has no explicit enable for architecture, we don't look
    at the project metadata and enable the build in the package. We should
    look at the project metadata.
+ 'osc gnome buildsubmit':
  - do nothing with --forward option when the user has not enough privilege to
    forward
+ Kill usage of http_GET, http_PUT (?)
+ Output an error if the project passed with --project does not exist (?)
