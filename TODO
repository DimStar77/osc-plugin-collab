+ Put server code in git.
+ Make the code work with all development repos, and not just GNOME:Factory.
+ Make 'osc gnome ta' tell you about packages with no upstream info?
+ Use get_obs_build_results for 'osc gnome ta'
+ Make --xs the default for 'osc gnome t/ta'
  For ta: it makes sense if the submitted revision is the current revision
  in G:F.
  For t: maybe check the version in the home project?
+ Prefill the .changes with "Updated translations"?
+ Have a "commit, wait for build success on OBS, submit to G:F" command
  'osc gnome buildsubmit'/'osc gnome bs'
  With a --forward option that makes it possible to automatically forward
  the submission to oS:F if the user has the permission to do so.
  Check the build status every 2 minutes when it's "scheduled" and every minute
  when it's "building".
  If the user presses enter, print the last known status, with the last check
  time.
+ Finish osc gnome forward.
+ Support a list of projects instead of just --project or gnome_project.
  This would be useful for people working on more than one project.
+ Output an error if the project passed with --project does not exist.
+ Document --project.
