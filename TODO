+ Put server code in git.
+ Make --xs the default for 'osc gnome t/ta'
  For ta: it makes sense if the submitted revision is the current revision
  in G:F.
  For t: maybe check the version in the home project?
+ add 'osc gnome validate/check': make sure that committing is fine
+ 'osc gnome update':
  - prefill the .changes with "Updated translations"?
    (Magnus has a patch)
  - check integrity with md5sum/sha1sum
  - clean the spec file (?):
    . one BuildRequires/Requires per line and alphabetically sorted
    . correctly order Name, License, Group, BuildRequires, etc.
+ 'osc gnome todoadmin':
  - use get_obs_build_results
  - handle the case where there's already a submission to oS:F but the
    submission is not from the latest revision of the package in G:F
+ 'osc gnome forward':
  - cancel old requests (automatically? ask?)
  - use 'osc meta prj GNOME:Factory' to see how to check for permissions.
+ 'osc gnome build/buildsubmit':
  - if the package has no explicit enable for architecture, we don't look
    at the project metadata and enable the build in the package. We should
    look at the project metadata.
+ 'osc gnome buildsubmit':
  - do nothing with --forward option when the user has not enough privilege to
    forward
  - automatically unreserve (if it was reserved), with a --no-unreserve option.
+ Kill usage of http_GET, http_PUT (?)
+ Add --no-cache option to force the plugin to not use caches.
+ Output an error if the project passed with --project does not exist (?)
+ Document:
  - usage with --project, or multiple projects.
  - 'osc gnome build', 'osc gnome buildsubmit'
