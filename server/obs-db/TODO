buildservice:
 + if we queue something twice, then we will really do it twice. We should have
   a way to queue, and then strip the useless elements to minimize data.

database:
 + only do one update call if there was a commit and meta change for a package
 + the errors set in _not_real_devel_package() cannot be "reverted" if the
   parent is updated but not the package itself
!+ database::add_project(): if there's no config for the project, then there's
   no parent, so there'll be really no config

general:
 + if one day, we inherit checkout-devel-projects, then we will have to make
   sure the settings are also inherited recursively
 + add command-line options to force checkout of a project or a package
