buildservice:
 + if we queue something twice, then we will really do it twice. We should have
   a way to queue, and then strip the useless elements to minimize data.
 + a project configuration cache can be written twice (eg, when a project is
   devel project for two different projects). This should be avoided since we
   probably expect the first write to win (assuming the first write matches the
   first project in obs.conf).

database:
 + only do one update call if there was a commit and meta change for a package
 + the errors set in _not_real_devel_package() cannot be "reverted" if the
   parent is updated but not the package itself
 + provide the API needed by infoxml so that it doesn't need to do any SQL
   query?
