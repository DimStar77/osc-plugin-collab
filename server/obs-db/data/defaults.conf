[General]
####
# General settings, with default values
####
## API URL for the build service. Defaults to the default osc API URL.
# apiurl =
#
## Base URL for Hermes installation matching the build service instance used.
## If no base URL is provided, then more requests will have to be done to the
## server to update the data.
# hermes-baseurl =
#
## List of Hermes feeds id to monitor to know about the changes in the build
## service. Use a ',' to separate the different ids. If no id is provided, then
## more requests will have to be done to the server to update the data.
# hermes-feeds =
#
## Where to store all the data that will be created.
# cache-dir = ./cache
#
## Ignore the mtime changes for the configuration file. Usually, when the
## configuration file has a different mtime, we recheck everything. This might
## not be the intended behavior. Note that this does not apply to mtime changes
## to non-user configuration file (like opensuse.conf).
# ignore-conf-mtime = False
#
## Do not do any full check of the mirror checkout. This can be needed if you
## want to always manually handle the full check (instead of having this done
## automatically).
# no-full-check = False
#
## Maximum number of threads to use. Set to 1 to disable threads.
# threads = 10
#
## Timeout for sockets (in seconds). Putting a long timeout can slow down
## things, especially as the build service sometimes keeps hanging connections
## without any reason. Use 0 to not change anything.
## Note: because of https://bugzilla.osafoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2341 and
## the fact that osc uses M2Crypto, we can't set a low timeout without
## affecting security. To use this setting, you'll have to set sslcertck=0 for
## the appropriate build server in ~/.oscrc. Else, this setting will be
## ignored.
# sockettimeout = 30
#
## Timeout for sockets used by threads. For technical reasons, we can work
## around the above issue with M2Crypto for the threads checking out the files
## from the build service. Since the timeouts are most likely to happen there,
## having an easy to use workaround makes sense.
## Set to 0 to use sockettimeout.
# threads-sockettimeout = 30

[Debug]
####
# Debug settings, with default values
####
## Provide debug output.
# debug = False
#
## If the mirror step will check/checkout all projects, only process the ones
## that have no checkout at the moment. This is useful after changing the
## configuration to add new projects, if you want a fast update (instead of
## triggering a check for all projects).
# mirror-only-new = False
#
## If the mirror step would check/checkout all projects because of a
## configuration change, then make it use the hermes update. This also applies
## to the db step that would rebuild. This is useful after changing the
## configuration without changing projects, if you want a fast update (instead
## of triggering a check for all projects).
# force-hermes = False
#
## Force full rebuild of the upstream db.
# force-upstream = False
#
## Force full rebuild of the main db.
# force-db = False
#
## Force creation of the xml.
# force-xml = False
#
## Whether to pretend there's no change in hermes or not.
# skip-hermes = False
#
## Whether to skip the mirror step.
# skip-mirror = False
#
## Whether to skip the upstream db step.
# skip-upstream = False
#
## Whether to skip the main db step.
# skip-db = False
#
## Whether to skip the main xml step.
# skip-xml = False


[Defaults]
####
# Settings that will apply to all projects, unless overloaded
####
## Whether or not to also check out devel projects of this project. Note that
## this is not inherited by the devel projects.
# checkout-devel-projects = False
#
## Sets a default parent project, to know where packages should end. For
## example, the parent project of GNOME:Factory is openSUSE:Factory (even though
## not all packages in GNOME:Factory really exists in openSUSE:Factory). This is
## generally used to know when a link is not set to the right parent, or to
## compare packages to parent packages, even if they're not links.
# parent = 
#
## Which branch to use for upstream versions.
# branch = 
#
## Whether the fallback data about upstream versions should be ignored. This is
## generally needed when you're only interested in a subset of upstream
## versions.
# ignore-fallback = False
#
## Whether to ignore the project/package a link points to and always use the
## configured parent project of this project as parent for the packages?
## This is useful for projects that are kept in sync with copypac instead of
## linkpac (and when the devel project links to another parent project).
## For example: parent is openSUSE:Published, but package is
## openSUSE:Devel/test and links to openSUSE:11.1/test
# force-project-parent = False
#
## Whether to ignore changes in .changes, or useless changes in .spec, when
## comparing non-link packages to find a delta.
# lenient-delta = False


####
# To specify a project to analyze (like home:vuntz), create a new section named
# 'Project home:vuntz'. Settings will be inherited from the Defaults section,
# but can be overloaded.
# Note that those settings are inherited by devel projects that will be checked
# out via the checkout-devel-projects option.
# Example:
# [Project home:vuntz]
# lenient-delta = True
