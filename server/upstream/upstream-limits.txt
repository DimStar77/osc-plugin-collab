# This file is used to express limits we want to have on new upstream tarballs.
#
# It's possible to decide to:
#
#  + not have unstable versions (for modules following the x.y.z release
#    scheme, where it's unstable when y is odd)
#    Use the no-odd-unstable instruction for this behavior.
#
#  + not have a version greater or equal than a specified version.
#    Use the "max|x.y" instruction for this behavior.
#

# libflashsupport has some tarballs with a date instead of version
libflashsupport:max|2000
# libofx used 0.11 as 0.1.1...
libofx:max|0.10

# we don't want unstable versions of the following modules
gq:no-odd-unstable
swfdec:no-odd-unstable
swfdec-mozilla:no-odd-unstable

# branches
gobby|0.4:max|0.4.90

# For openSUSE 11.3
#cairo:max|1.9
#telepathy-glib:max|0.11

# At least for openSUSE 11.4:
dbus:no-odd-unstable
libdmapsharing:no-odd-unstable
liferea:no-odd-unstable
# Modules that follow a six-months cycle, and will be released in march, too late for 11.4
pixman:no-odd-unstable
telepathy-glib:no-odd-unstable
